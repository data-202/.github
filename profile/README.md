 In this course, students will develop an understanding of statistics as a research tool. Students are expected to have some basic knowledge of statistics from a prior course. Emphasis will be placed on understanding statistical concepts and applying and interpreting tests of statistical inference for real-life applications. The content will include, but not be limited to, visual representations of data, descriptive statistics, correlation and simple regression, sampling distributions, and the assumptions associated with and the application of selected inferential statistical procedures. Throughout the course, there will be a strong emphasis on how statistical modeling can be a driving force for social justice.
